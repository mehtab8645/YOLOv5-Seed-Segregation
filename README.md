# Seed Segregation using Image Processing (YOLOv5)

This project aims to automate seed quality detection using a custom YOLOv5 object detection model.

## Tools & Technologies:
- YOLOv5
- Python
- Roboflow (for dataset annotation)
- Raspberry Pi & Arduino Uno (for hardware integration)
- OpenCV & Microscopic Cameras

## Outcome:
- Real-time detection of good/bad seeds
- Project published in IEEE International Conference (2023)

## Authors:
- Mohammed Mehtab Alam and Team
